# Probalistic-Language-Model-Ngram
To use this program, simply download training.txt and PLM.inpy and the repos.csv if you want to use the same data. 
If you wish to use different data, edit the code to replace ('/content/Repos.csv')  with the path of your data. 
After doing so, you must run all of the code and the data will be outputted into results_student.json and results_teacher,json.
